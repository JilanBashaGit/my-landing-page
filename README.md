# My Landing Page - Test Assignment

Simple responsive landing page built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Local preview (what to do)
1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   - Right-click `index.html` → Open with Default Browser
   - OR install a VS Code extension like "Live Server" and click "Go Live".

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (quick steps)
1. Create GitHub account (if you don't have one) at https://github.com.
2. Create a new repository named `my-landing-page` (public).
3. On your PC open Terminal (or VS Code integrated terminal):
   - `cd` into the project folder.
   - Run these commands:
     ```
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git branch -M main
     git remote add origin https://github.com/JilanBashaGit/my-landing-page.git
     git push -u origin main
     ```
4. Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Pages → Under "Source" choose `main` branch and `/ (root)` → Save.
5. After a minute, your site will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/my-landing-page/`

## Notes
- No frameworks used. Only vanilla JS.
- If you prefer I can give step-by-step GitHub screenshots — just ask.
